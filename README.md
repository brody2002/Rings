# Rings
Rings is an IOS app I built out of personal need. I wanted a way to automate the procedure of making a ringtone as painless as possible. This included fetching a youtube video, making it a m4a file, slicing the snippet of audio that I wanted, and then finally making a ringtone that I could actually use.

The Rings project although a great demonstration and project unfortunetly won't be put out on the appstore of legal reasons...

The Project demo can be foundn here by clicking on this [YouTube Link](https://youtu.be/WetIV1mZWHU)
