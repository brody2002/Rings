# Rings
Rings is an IOS app I built out of personal need. I wanted a way to automate the procedure of making a ringtone as painless as possible. This included fetching a youtube video, making it a m4a file, slicing the snippet of audio that I wanted, and then finally making a ringtone that I could actually use.

The Rings project although a great demonstration and project unfortunetly won't be put out on the appstore due to legal reasons...

Additionally, Apple doesnt have any methods to have access to the ringtones folder on the IPhone which mean I couldn't do anything more than just creating a .band file myself and navigating users to make their garage band project a usable ringtone. 

The Project demo can be foundn here by clicking on this [YouTube Link](https://youtu.be/WetIV1mZWHU)
